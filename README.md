## Description

This project develops a cloud-based platform for real-time monitoring of the Rzecin peatland study area. The platform integrates data from various sensor types, providing a comprehensive view of the peatland's ecological status and dynamics.

## Peatland Area

Rzecin is a valuable peatland ecosystem, characterized by its unique hydrological regime and vegetation composition. Peatlands play a crucial role in carbon storage, water regulation, and biodiversity conservation. Monitoring the peatland is essential to understand its response to environmental changes and to ensure its long-term preservation.

## Sensors

The platform will manage the data from the following sensors:

*   **Eddy Covariance System:** Measures the fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the peatland and the atmosphere.
*   **Spectrometers:** Capture spectral reflectance data, which can be used to monitor vegetation health and species composition.
*   **Pheno Cams:** Provide visual information about the phenological development of vegetation.
*   **Other IoT Sensors:** These can include a range of sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, water level sensors, temperature sensors, and more, providing additional data on the peatland's biophysical state.
